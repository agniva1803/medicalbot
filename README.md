## 🩺 MedicalBot – AI-Driven Symptom Checker

An intelligent healthcare chatbot system designed to assist users with preliminary medical queries by analyzing symptoms and offering possible diagnoses. This AI-powered chatbot enhances healthcare accessibility, supports early disease detection, and delivers fast, accurate responses using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed during an internship at **Tata Steel Ltd.**, combining AI, NLP, and adaptive querying techniques to build a scalable, responsive, and reliable chatbot system. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that enables quick medical assessments and reduces misdiagnosis through continuous feedback.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Symptom-Based Diagnosis**  
  Identify potential diseases by analyzing user-provided symptoms.

- 🧠 **NLP-Powered Conversations**  
  Seamless, context-aware dialogue using Natural Language Processing.

- 🗃️ **SQL-Based Symptom Repository**  
  Efficient query handling and fast data retrieval using relational databases.

- 🔁 **Adaptive Query Model**  
  Improves accuracy over time by learning from user feedback.

- 📈 **Accuracy-Optimized AI Engine**  
  Boosted diagnostic accuracy by 20% with machine learning models (TensorFlow).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** Flask, TensorFlow  
- **Database:** SQLite / MySQL  
- **Libraries:** NLTK, Pandas, NumPy  

## 🧪 Testing & Results

- Implemented extensive test cases to ensure chatbot stability.
- Achieved:
  - ✅ 20% improvement in diagnosis accuracy
  - ✅ 25% faster symptom resolution
  - ✅ 18% reduction in false positives through adaptive learning
